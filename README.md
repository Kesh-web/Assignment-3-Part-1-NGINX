# Assignment-3-Part-1-NGINX

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on building and configuring a simple automated system to generate and serve system information as a static HTML page. The task involves scripting, system administration, and secure server management. Specifically, we will:

- Create a system user for secure script execution.
- Automate script execution daily using `systemd` services and timers.
- Configure Nginx to serve the HTML file on an Arch Linux server.
- Secure the server using a firewall configured with `ufw`.

The assignment includes using skills such as Bash scripting, `systemd` management, web server configuration, and basic firewall security.

## Task 1: Setting up System User with Ownership and Directories

The first step is creating the system user `webgen` with a home directory of `/var/lib/webgen`, giving it ownership, and  an appropriate login shell for a non-login user.

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -r -d /var/lib/webgen -s /usr/sbin/nologin webgen
```
### Explanation of `useradd` Options

- **`-r` system account:**  
  Creates a system user with a UID below 1000. System users are typically used for non-login tasks like running services.

- **`-d` home directory:**  
  Specifies the userâ€™s home directory path, in our case its  `/var/lib/webgen`.

- **`-s` shell:**  
  Sets the login shell. Using `/usr/sbin/nologin` disables interactive logins for `webgen`, which is ideal for system users.

The benefit of using these specific options when creating the system user is

**Non-login Tasks:**  
   System users are typically used for non-login tasks, such as running services, by ensuring that they do not require interactive login capabilities.

### Creating Subdirectories `/bin` and `/HTML`

We need to create the following subdirectories within the `webgen` directory. To do so type the following:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/bin
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/HTML
```

### Cloning the `generate_index` Script into `/bin/`

To set up the `generate_index` script, you can clone it from the sourcehut repo and place it in the `/bin/` directory. 


1. First cd into the `/bin/` directory:
```bash
cd /var/lib/webgen/bin
```

2. Second clone the repo with the following 
```bash 
git clone https://sr.ht/~user/repo.git generate_index
```
3. Third make sure the script is executable
```bash 
sudo chmod +x /var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
```

### Setting Ownership for the `webgen` System User

By running the following command `webgen` user has ownership of its home directory and all subdirectories and files.
```bash
sudo chown -R webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen
```


## Task 2:
To start the first step would be creating the service file `generate-index.service` that would run the `generate_index` script.

```bash 
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/system/generate-index.service
```
Once youre in there you can edit it and add the following:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Generate Index Service File

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
```

### Explanation of the Service File

#### [Unit]:
- **Description**: A brief description of the service.

#### [Service]:
- **Type=simple**: This tells systemd that the service is a simple service that does not fork. It starts immediately and runs in the foreground. 
- **ExecStart=/var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index**: Specifies the command that will be executed when the service starts. Here, it runs the `generate_index` script located in `/var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index`.

- **Type=simple**: This means that the service is considered started immediately when the `ExecStart` command 





### Explanation of Setting Ownership Options

`-R`
 command changes the ownership of `/var/lib/webgen` and all files and subdirectories within it, making sure that all files in the directory are owned by the `webgen` user and group.
